# WinApps Configuration for NixOS

This directory contains NixOS configuration scripts for WinApps, a system that allows you to run Windows applications seamlessly on Linux.

## üìÅ Files

- **`winapps.nix`** - Main installation and configuration script
- **`winapps-test.nix`** - Test script to verify installation
- **`WINAPPS_README.md`** - This documentation file

## üöÄ Quick Start

After rebuilding your NixOS configuration, you'll have access to these commands:

### 1. Install and Configure WinApps
```bash
winapps-setup
```

This script will:
- Install WinApps packages via nix profile
- Install FreeRDP dependency
- Create configuration files
- Start Windows container (if available)
- Run WinApps setup
- Create convenience scripts

### 2. Test Your Installation
```bash
winapps-test
```

This will verify that everything is working correctly.

### 3. Use WinApps
```bash
# Launch Office applications
winapps-launch word      # Microsoft Word
winapps-launch excel     # Microsoft Excel
winapps-launch powerpoint # Microsoft PowerPoint
winapps-launch outlook   # Microsoft Outlook

# Launch Windows tools
winapps-launch explorer  # Windows Explorer
winapps-launch cmd       # Command Prompt
winapps-launch windows   # Full Windows Desktop

# Show available applications
winapps-desktop
```

## üîß Manual Commands

If you prefer to use the commands directly:

```bash
# Office applications
winapps word-o365
winapps excel-o365
winapps powerpoint-o365
winapps outlook-o365
winapps onenote-o365
winapps access
winapps publisher-o365

# Windows tools
winapps explorer
winapps cmd
winapps powershell
winapps iexplorer
winapps windows
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The main configuration file is located at `~/.config/winapps/winapps.conf`.

**Important:** You need to edit this file with your actual Windows credentials:

```bash
nano ~/.config/winapps/winapps.conf
```

Update these lines:
```bash
RDP_USER="your-windows-username"
RDP_PASS="your-windows-password"
```

## üê≥ Windows Container

This configuration assumes you're using Podman with a Windows container. The script will:

1. Check if the container is running
2. Start it if needed using `podman compose up -d`
3. Wait for it to be ready before proceeding

Make sure your Windows container is properly configured in `~/winapps/compose.yaml`.

## üì± Available Applications

### Officially Supported (13 applications):
- **Microsoft Office 365**: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, Access, Publisher
- **Windows Tools**: Explorer, Command Prompt, PowerShell, Internet Explorer
- **Windows Desktop**: Full Windows RDP session

### Detected Applications (64 total):
The system detects many more Windows applications, but only the officially supported ones are automatically configured. You can access all applications through the Windows Desktop.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Application not found" error**
   - Run `winapps-setup` to reconfigure
   - Check if Windows container is running: `podman ps`

2. **Permission denied errors**
   - Run `chmod -R 755 ~/.local/share/winapps/`
   - Check file ownership

3. **RDP connection failures**
   - Verify Windows credentials in `~/.config/winapps/winapps.conf`
   - Check if Windows container is accessible
   - Ensure FreeRDP is installed

4. **Applications not appearing in desktop**
   - Run `winapps-setup --user --setupAllOfficiallySupportedApps`
   - Check `~/.local/share/applications/` directory

### Logs:
- WinApps logs: `~/.local/share/winapps/winapps.log`
- FreeRDP logs: `~/.local/share/winapps/FreeRDP_*.log`
